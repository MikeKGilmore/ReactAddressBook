# ReactAddressBook

This project demonstrates the following:

ASP.NET Web API 2
[x] Created a restful endpoint for the application (see /Controllers/AddressBookController.cs)
[x] For the route, see /App_Start/RouteConfig.cs
	
I had enabled Session State for the AddressBook Controller route but didn't have time to fully use it.
Static data is used instead (defined in the controller).

ReactJS
[x] Demonstrates modular, component-based design
[x] Uses component state to switch between view & edit modes
[x] Consumes the AddressBookController REST interface
[x] Data is updated via REST
[x] Bootstrap.css is used for limited styling

This Assignment was a crash course on ReactJS.  The bulk of the time spent (>85%) was spent learning the
React paradigm.  Unfortunately that means there were some items on the assignment that I was not able to
complete (AngularJS poisoned my mind!).
